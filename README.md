# The Noder - An Opinionated Generator

This project scaffolds a modern Node application. It is fairly opinionated, but is customizable and extensible.

Here's the mile-long list of technologies the generated project can leverage:

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Compile modern ECMAScript to Node-compatible JS
- [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Execute lint-staged before committing to Git
- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) - Execute linters for specific file types
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Apply hundreds of style/usage rules to ECMAScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Apply style/formatting rules to code
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Test framework
